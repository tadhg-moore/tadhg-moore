The [FLARE project](https://flare-forecast.org/) creates open-source software for flexible, scalable, robust, and near-real time iterative ecological forecasts in lakes and reservoirs. FLARE is composed of water temperature and meteorology sensors that wirelessly stream data, a data assimilation algorithm that uses sensor observations to update predictions from a hydrodynamic model and calibrate model parameters, and an ensemble-based forecasting algorithm to generate forecasts that include uncertainty.
