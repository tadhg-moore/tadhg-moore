Climate extreme events, like heat waves, droughts, and floods, stress ecosystems and compromise their capacity to provide key services related to water. However, despite the vulnerability of the water quality sector to climate extremes, there has been limited development of solution-oriented tools integrating Climate Services and ecosystem impacts modeling.

WATExR (”water-ex”) aims to integrate state-of-the-art climate seasonal prediction and water quality simulation in a QGIS-based advanced solution to ensure efficient decision making and adaptation of water resources management to an increased frequency of climate extreme events.
