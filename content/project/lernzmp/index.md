The platform integrates data from Regional Councils, NIWA, Freshwater Ecosystems of New Zealand (FENZ), and Land Information New Zealand (LINZ), alongside satellite remote sensing, to enable scenario simulations for up to 1,500 lakes. This allows lake managers and researchers to: 

-   Assess individual lake models within a regional and national context

-   Identify lakes at risk of degradation and prioritise restoration interventions

-   Evaluate the impacts of climate change and nutrient load reductions on water quality.
