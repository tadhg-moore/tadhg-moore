  abstract = "Freshwater ecosystems provide vital services, yet are facing
              increasing risks from global change. In particular, lake thermal
              dynamics have been altered around the world as a result of
              climate change, necessitating a predictive understanding of how
              climate will continue to alter lakes in the future as well as the
              associated uncertainty in these predictions. Numerous sources of
              uncertainty affect projections of future lake conditions but few
              are quantified, limiting the use of lake modeling projections as
              management tools. To quantify and evaluate the effects of two
              potentially important sources of uncertainty, lake model
              selection uncertainty and climate model selection uncertainty, we
              developed ensemble projections of lake thermal dynamics for a
              dimictic lake in New Hampshire, USA (Lake Sunapee). Our ensemble
              projections used four different climate models as inputs to five
              vertical one-dimensional (1-D) hydrodynamic lake models under
              three different climate change scenarios to simulate thermal
              metrics from 2006 to 2099. We found that almost all the lake
              thermal metrics modeled (surface water temperature, bottom water
              temperature, Schmidt stability, stratification duration, and ice
              cover, but not thermocline depth) are projected to change over
              the next century. Importantly, we found that the dominant source
              of uncertainty varied among the thermal metrics, as thermal
              metrics associated with the surface waters (surface water
              temperature, total ice duration) were driven primarily by climate
              model selection uncertainty, while metrics associated with deeper
              depths (bottom water temperature, stratification duration) were
              dominated by lake model selection uncertainty. Consequently, our
              results indicate that researchers generating projections of lake
              bottom water metrics should prioritize including multiple lake
              models for best capturing projection uncertainty, while those
              focusing on lake surface metrics should prioritize including
              multiple climate models. Overall, our ensemble modeling study
              reveals important information on how climate change will affect
              lake thermal properties, and also provides some of the first
              analyses on how climate model selection uncertainty and lake
              model selection uncertainty interact to affect projections of
              future lake dynamics.",
