  abstract = "Ecosystems around the globe are experiencing increased
              variability due to land use and climate change. In response,
              ecologists are increasingly using near-term, iterative ecological
              forecasts to predict how ecosystems will change in the future. To
              date, many near-term, iterative forecasting systems have been
              developed using high temporal frequency (minute to hourly
              resolution) data streams for assimilation. However, this approach
              may be cost-prohibitive or impossible for forecasting ecological
              variables that lack high-frequency sensors or have high data
              latency (i.e., a delay before data are available for modeling
              after collection). To explore the effects of data assimilation
              frequency on forecast skill, we developed water temperature
              forecasts for a eutrophic drinking water reservoir and conducted
              data assimilation experiments by selectively withholding
              observations to examine the effect of data availability on
              forecast accuracy. We used in-situ sensors, manually collected
              data, and a calibrated water quality ecosystem model driven by
              forecasted weather data to generate future water temperature
              forecasts using FLARE (Forecasting Lake And Reservoir
              Ecosystems), an open-source water quality forecasting system. We
              tested the effect of daily, weekly, fortnightly, and monthly data
              assimilation on the skill of 1 to 35-day-ahead water temperature
              forecasts. We found that forecast skill varied depending on the
              season, forecast horizon, depth, and data assimilation frequency,
              but overall forecast performance was high, with a mean
              1-day-ahead forecast root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.94°C,
              mean 7-day RMSE of 1.33°C, and mean 35-day RMSE of 2.15°C.
              Aggregated across the year, daily data assimilation yielded the
              most skillful forecasts at 1-7-day-ahead horizons, weekly data
              assimilation resulted in the most skillful forecasts at
              8-35-day-ahead horizons. Within a year, daily to fortnightly data
              assimilation substantially outperformed monthly data assimilation
              in the stratified summer period, whereas all data assimilation
              frequencies resulted in skillful forecasts across depths in the
              mixed spring/autumn periods for shorter forecast horizons. Our
              results suggest that lower-frequency data (i.e., weekly) may be
              adequate for developing accurate forecasts in some applications,
              further enabling the development of forecasts broadly across
              ecosystems and ecological variables without high-frequency sensor
              data.",
