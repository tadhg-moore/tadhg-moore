The Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON) conducts innovative science by sharing and interpreting high-resolution sensor data to understand, predict and communicate the role and response of lakes in a changing global environment.

[GLEON](https://gleon.org/) envisions:
  - A worldwide network of instrumented buoys on lakes, placing critical lake information at the fingertips of researchers, managers, and the general public
  - A research environment that fosters collaboration across disciplines and political borders
  - An international community of scientists, educators, policy makers, and citizens invested in the future of fresh waters
